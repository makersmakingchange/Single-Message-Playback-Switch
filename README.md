# Single Message Playback Switch
The Single Message Playback Switch is a switch adapted device that can store and play back a single 30 second message. The device can be used both as a toy or as a communication aid. A commercially available voice recording button is modified so that it can be activated using a secondary assistive switch with a 3.5 mm plug. 

To setup the device, a carer or helper needs to press the record button and require the desired message or sound. An assistive switch is then connected to the 3.5 mm jack.  To use the device, activate the assistive switch. When the assistive switch is activated, the pre-recorded message or sound will be played through the speaker. The device can also be activated direcly by pressing the integrated button on the top.
